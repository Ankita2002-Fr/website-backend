## Getting Started

Instructions for initial setup can be found in the [README](README.md).

## NPM Command Reference

##### `npm install`

Installs all `dependencies` listed in the root `package.json`.

##### `npm run test`

The script associated with `npm run test` will run all tests that ensures that your commit does not break anything in the
repository. This will run the lint, integration and unit tests.

##### `npm run lint`
Runs the lint checks in the project.

##### `npm run generate-api-schema`
Generates the API schema in the file `public/apiSchema.json`.

##### `npm run test-config`
Runs the test for checking local development setup is working properly or not.

```

## Generating Authentication Token
- Run the project locally, make sure the server is listening to requests
- Navigate to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=<GITHUB_CLIENT_ID>`
- Authorize the application
- Copy the response cookie named rds-session from the redirected request <HOST>/auth/github/callback?code=<SOME_AUTOGENERATED_CODE>
- Use the cookie for authenticated routes in the API.
- For non-production environments, authentication is also supported with the `Authorization` header.
- Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Pull request guidelines
- Ensure that the tests pass locally before raising a PR.
- All pull requests should be to the develop branch. 
- Every pull request should have associated issue(s) on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Real-Dev-Squad/website-backend/issues).
- For any non-trivial fixes and features, unit and integration tests must be added. The PR reviewer should not approve/merge PR(s) that lack these.
- The PR(s) should be merged only after the CI passes.
